# OmniQA Lab

OmniQA Lab is a milti-stack quality engineering portfolio that demostrates:
 - **UI automation** (Selenium & Playwright in Java, Python, Typescript)

 - **API testing** (Requests, RestAssured, Playwright, APIRequestContext)

 - **Performance testing** (JMeter/ Locust)

 - **Manual test design** (Markdown-style test cases)

 - **CI/CD publishing** with GitHub Actions (auto-generated html reports)

 The goal is to showcase a **unified QA skillset** across popular industry stacks while maintaining a **clean, modular structure**.

## ðŸ”„ Shared Models & Data

- **Why?** Instead of rewriting test data or user models in each language, we define them once in `shared/`.
- **Format:** JSON/YAML for data (easily read by Java, Python, and TS).
- **Usage Examples:**
  - Java: use Jackson to parse `shared/models/user.json`
  - Python: use `json` module to load the same file
  - TypeScript: import JSON directly with Node/Playwright

This ensures **consistency** across all test stacks.

## ðŸš€ Running Tests

Each stack has its own README with setup instructions, but in general:

### Java (Selenium + API)
cd selenium-java
mvn test

Python (Selenium / Playwright / API)
cd selenium-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests

Playwright TypeScript
cd playwright-typescript
npm install
npx playwright test

Performance (JMeter)
cd performance-tests
# Run inside Docker or locally with JMeter

ðŸ“Š Reports

On each push, GitHub Actions runs every suite and publishes fresh HTML reports to GitHub Pages.
